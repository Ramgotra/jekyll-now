These are pretty self explanatory and yield no XP.

* Move with W, A, S & D keys
* Double left click to talk 
* Speak with Arabella

* Find the Oracle
* Enter the building
* Speak with the Oracle
* Answer the Oracle
  Ignore the bla bla and type or select "ready to begin". The Oracle will ask 3 or 4 questions and give two options. Depending on your answers, it will suggest a path for you. I fact it only counts the adverbs from your answers. As soon as you score two of either "courageously", "lovingly" or "truthfully", your suggested path is determined as "courage", "love" or - you guessed it - "truth". Your path also determines your "class" and your starting scene:
  ** Path of Love -> Ranger -> Solace Bridge
  ** Path of Courage -> Fighter -> Highvale
  ** Path of Truth -> Mage -> Blood River
* Enter the luna rift
