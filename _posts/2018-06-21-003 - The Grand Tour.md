title: The Grand Tour
---

This is a simple travel quest, which gets you the Shardfall cloak.

Check the [Lunar Rift Chronometer](https://sacrifice-guild.enjin.com/lrchronometer);
although you can start the tour at any one of the six locations, I prefer to start on the
Isle of Storms when the rift points to Highvale. Jump through any rift to Highvale and
immediately jump again to be taken to the Isle of Storms.

You'll find the Mysteriously Placed Tour Guide between the Oracle and the Lunar Rift.

* Isle of Storms: Mysteriously Placed Tour Guide (Loc -24.5, 16.0, -7.4), "ready to begin"
* Brookside: Brookside Tour Guide (Loc 35.0, 37.5, -159.7)
* Owl's Head: Owl's Head Tour Guide (123.9, 72.1, 59.9)
* Westend: Westend Tour Guide (89.9, 16.7, -34.7)
* Brittany: Brittany Graveyard -> Central Brittany (-9.4, 27.5, -95.2)
